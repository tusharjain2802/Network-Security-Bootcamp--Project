# SHAPEAI PYTHON AND NETWORK SECURITY BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr. Harsh Akshit (Community Lead at GOOGLE and OWASP). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>INTRO TO PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON
<li>INTRODUCTION TO Selenium for Web automation
<li>Networking Fundamentals â€“ OSI Model, TCP/UDP, Routing & Switching
<li>NMAP Scanning
<li>Web application Recon/ Information gathering on live targets
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
